the disguised images that was made in disgued players when run in app.js needs to be passsed back to appljs to final display the images and its disguesed images in the final page
To achieve this, we need to modify the DisguisePlayer component to pass the disguised image back to the App component, and then update the App component to display both the original and disguised images in the final page. Here's how we can do this:
1.
First, let's modify the DisguisePlayer component to pass the disguised image back to the parent component:
vp_game-main
const DisguisePlayer = ({ player, onDisguise, onEncryptionDecision}) => {
  // ... existing code ...

  const handleSubmit = () => { 
    const disguisedImageCanvas = disguisedImageCanvasRef.current;
    const disguisedImageDataURL = disguisedImageCanvas.toDataURL();
    setShowMainContainer(false);
    onDisguise(disguisedImageDataURL); // Pass the disguised image data URL back to the parent
  };

  // ... rest of the component ...
};
Apply
2.
Now, let's update the App component to receive and store the disguised image:
vp_game-main
export default function App() {
  // ... existing state variables ...
  const [disguisedImage, setDisguisedImage] = useState(null);

  // ... existing code ...

  const handleDisguise = (disguisedImageDataURL) => {
    setDisguisedImage(disguisedImageDataURL);
    setShowDisguisePlayer(false);
    setShowComparePlayers(true);
  };

  // ... existing code ...

  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* ... existing code ... */}

      {showDisguisePlayer && currentPlayer && (
        <DisguisePlayer
          player={currentPlayer}
          onDisguise={handleDisguise}
          onEncryptionDecision={handleWantsEncryption}
        />
      )}

      {showComparePlayers && currentPlayer && disguisedImage && (
        <ComparePlayers
          originalPlayer={currentPlayer}
          disguisedPlayer={{ ...currentPlayer, src: disguisedImage }}
        />
      )}

      {/* ... rest of the component ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
Apply
3.
Finally, let's update the ComparePlayers component to display both the original and disguised images:
vp_game-main
import React from 'react';

const ComparePlayers = ({ originalPlayer, disguisedPlayer }) => {
  return (
    <div className="compare-players">
      <h2>Compare Original and Disguised Images</h2>
      <div className="image-comparison">
        <div className="original-image">
          <h3>Original Image</h3>
          <img src={originalPlayer.src} alt="Original Player" />
        </div>
        <div className="disguised-image">
          <h3>Disguised Image</h3>
          <img src={disguisedPlayer.src} alt="Disguised Player" />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ComparePlayers;
Apply
These changes will allow the disguised image created in the DisguisePlayer component to be passed back to the App component and then displayed alongside the original image in the ComparePlayers component.
Make sure to import the ComparePlayers component in your App.js file if you haven't already:
import ComparePlayers from "./ComparePlayers";
Apply
With these modifications, the flow will be:
1.
User selects a player
2.
User applies disguise in the DisguisePlayer component
3.
Disguised image is passed back to App component
4.
App component shows the ComparePlayers component with both original and disguised images
This should achieve the desired functionality of displaying both the original and disguised images in the final page.
